                    I graduated with a Bachelor of Building Services Engineering.
                    During almost 10 years of life being a BS engineer,
                    I gained valuable experience in project management,
                    problem-solving, and attention to detail.
                    Due to a conversation with a friend of mine,
                    I started to learn programming through various online courses
                    and personal projects after work.
                    Meanwhile, I discovered my passion for it and decided to make a career change.<br />
                    <br />
                    As a self-taught programmer, I have honed my skills in programming languages such as
                    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have experience working with front-end frameworks
                    such as React.js and Bootstrap. I have also taken online courses and completed
                    personal projects to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest
                    industry trends.<br />
                    <br />
                    My career transition has taught me the importance of adaptability, continuous learning,
                    and perseverance. I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that the IT industry
                    presents and I am ready to contribute to the continuously growing industry.</p>
