                I graduated with a Bachelor of Building Services Engineering. 
                During almost 10 years of life being a BS engineer, 
                I gained valuable experience in project management, 
                problem-solving, and attention to detail. 
                Due to a conversation with a friend of mine, 
                I started to learn programming through various online courses 
                and personal projects after work. 
                Meanwhile, I discovered my passion for it and decided to make a career change.<br />
                <br />
                As a self-taught programmer, I have honed my skills in programming languages such as 
                HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and have experience working with front-end frameworks 
                such as React and Git. I have also taken online courses and completed personal projects 
                to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.<br />
                <br />
                My career transition has taught me the importance of adaptability, continuous learning, 
                and perseverance. I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that the IT industry 
                presents and I am ready to contribute to the continuously growing industry.
