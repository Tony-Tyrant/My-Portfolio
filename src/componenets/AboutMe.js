                    I am a self-taught programmer. I have honed my skills in programming languages such as
                    <b> HTML</b>,<b> CSS</b> and <b>JavaScript</b> and have experience in front-end frameworks
                    such as <b>React.js</b>, <b>React-Redux</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b> and <b>Git</b> through
                    taking online courses and completing personal projects.<br />
                    <br />
                    I graduated with a Bachelor of Building Services Engineering.
                    During almost 10 years of life being a BS engineer,
                    I gained valuable experience in <b>project management</b>,
                    <b> problem-solving</b> and <b>attention to detail</b>.
                    Due to a conversation with a friend of mine,
                    I started to learn programming through various online courses
                    and personal projects after work.
                    Meanwhile, I discovered my passion for it and decided to make a career change.<br />                    
                    <br />
                    My career transition has taught me the importance of adaptability, continuous learning,
                    and perseverance. I am excited about the opportunities and challenges that the IT industry
                    presents and I am ready to contribute to the continuously growing industry.</p>
